# Failable Initializers

Swift version 1.1 is new in Xcode 6.1, and it introduces a new feature: failable initializers. Initialization is the process of providing initial values to each of the stored properties of a class or struct, establishing the invariants of the object. In some cases initialization can fail. For example, initializing the object requires access to a resource, such as loading an image from a file:  NSImage(contentsOfFile: "swift.png")
