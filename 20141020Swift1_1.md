# Failable Initializers

Swift version 1.1 is new in Xcode 6.1, and it introduces a new feature: failable initializers. Initialization is the process of providing initial values to each of the stored properties of a class or struct, establishing the invariants of the object. In some cases initialization can fail. For example, initializing the object requires access to a resource, such as loading an image from a file:  NSImage(contentsOfFile: "swift.png")

If the file does not exist or is unreadable for any reason, the initialization of the NSImage will fail. With Swift version 1.1, such failures can be reported using a failable initializer. When constructing an object using a failable initializer, the result is an optional that either contains the object (when the initialization succeeded) or contains nil (when the initialization failed). Therefore, the initialization above should handle the optional result directly:

```
if let image = NSImage(contentsOfFile: "swift.png") {
	// loaded the image successfully
} else {
	// could not load the image
}
```

An initializer defined with init can be made failable by adding a ? or a ! after the init, which indicates the form of optional that will be produced by constructing an object with that initializer. For example, one could add a failable initializer to Int that attempts to perform a conversion from a String:
```
extension Int {
	init?(fromString: String) { 
		if let i = fromString.toInt() {
			// Initialize
			self = i
		} else { 
			// return nil, discarding self is implied
			return nil
		}
	}
}
```

In a failable initializer, return nil indicates that initialization has failed; no other value can be returned. In the example, failure occurs when the string could not be parsed as an integer. Otherwise, self is initialized to the parsed value.

Failable initializers eliminate the most common reason for factory methods in Swift, which were previously the only way to report failure when constructing this object. For example, enums that have a raw type provided a factory method fromRaw that returned an optional enum. Now, the Swift compiler synthesizes a failable initializer that takes a raw value and attempts to map it to one of the enum cases. For example:
```
enum Color : Int {
	case Red = 0, Green = 1, Blue = 2

	// implicitly synthesized
	var rawValue: Int { /* returns raw value for current case */ }

	// implicitly synthesized
	init?(rawValue: Int) {
		switch rawValue { 
			case 0: self = .Red
			case 1: self = .Green
			case 2: self = .Blue
			default: return nil
		}
	}
}
```

Using the failable initializer allows greater use of Swift’s uniform construction syntax, which simplifies the language by eliminating the confusion and duplication between initializers and factory methods. Along with the introduction of failable initializers, Swift now treats more Cocoa factory methods — those with NSError arguments — as initializers, providing a more uniform experience for object construction.

# 20141111 Xcode6.1 Introduction to the Swift REPL
Xcode 6.1 introduces yet another way to experiment with Swift in the form of an interactive Read Eval Print Loop, or REPL. Developers familiar with interpreted languages will feel comfortable in this command-line environment, and even experienced developers will find a few unique features. To get started, launch Terminal.app (found in /Applications/Utilities) and type “swift” at the prompt in OS X Yosemite, or “xcrun swift” in OS X Mavericks. You’ll then be in the Swift REPL:
Welcome to Swift version 1.1 (swift-600.0.20.0). Type :help for assistance.
```
>
```

All you need to do is type Swift statements and the REPL will immediately execute your code. Expression results are automatically formatted and displayed along with their type, as are the results of both variable and constant declarations. Console output flows naturally within the interactive session:


# 12月更新 What Happened to NSMethodSignature?
UPDATE: We’ve added the Request.playground file to this post so you can download it and easily experiment with the code yourself.

Bringing the Cocoa frameworks to Swift gave us a unique opportunity to look at our APIs with a fresh perspective. We found classes that we didn't feel fit with the goals of Swift, most often due to the priority we give to safety. For instance, some classes related to dynamic method invocation are not exposed in Swift, namely NSInvocation and NSMethodSignature.

We recently received a bug report from a developer who noticed this absence. This developer was using NSMethodSignature in Objective-C to introspect the types of method arguments, and in the process of migrating this code to Swift, noticed that NSMethodSignature is not available. The code being migrated could accept HTTP handlers of varying signatures, such as:

```
func handleRequest(request: HTTPRequest, queryStringArguments: [String: String]) { }
func handleRequest(request: HTTPRequest, jsonBody: JSON) { }
```

In Objective-C, NSMethodSignature can be used to determine that the API of the first method would require a [String: String] argument, and the second method would require a JSON value. However, Swift is a powerful language and can easily handle this scenario without using NSMethodSignature, and in a way that doesn't undermine the help that the compiler provides for type and memory safety.

Here is an alternative way to solve the same problem in Swift:

struct HTTPRequest {
	// ...
}

protocol HTTPHandlerType {
	typealias Data

	/// :returns: true if the request was handled; false otherwise
	func handle(request: HTTPRequest, data: Data) -> Bool
}


struct HTTPRequest {
	// ...
}

protocol HTTPHandlerType {
	typealias Data

	/// :returns: true if the request was handled; false otherwise
	func handle(request: HTTPRequest, data: Data) -> Bool
}

```
class HTTPServer {
	func addHandler<T: HTTPHandlerType>(handler: T) {
		handlers.append { (request: HTTPRequest, args: Any) -> Bool in
			if let typedArgs = args as? T.Data {
				return handler.handle(request, data: typedArgs)
			}
			return false
		}
	}

	// ...
}
```


Next, our HTTPServer class has a generic method that accepts an HTTPHandlerType as a parameter. By using the handler's associated type, it can perform the conditional downcast of the args parameter to determine if this handler should be given an opportunity to handle the request. Here we can see the benefit of defining HTTPHandlerType as a protocol. The HTTPServer doesn't need to know how the handler is reacting to the request, nor does it even need to care about the nature of the handler itself. All it needs to know is that the value can handle requests.

```
class HTTPServer {
	// ...

	private var handlers: [(HTTPRequest, Any) -> Bool] = []

	func dispatch(req: HTTPRequest, args: Any) -> Bool {
		for handler in handlers {
			if handler(req, args) {
				return true
			}
		}
		return false
	}
}
```

When our HTTPServer receives a request, it will iterate through its handlers and see if any can deal with the request.

Now we can easily create a custom HTTPHandlerType with varying argument types and register it with the HTTPServer:

```
class MyHandler : HTTPHandlerType {
	func handle(request: HTTPRequest, data: Int) -> Bool {
		return data > 5
	}
}

let server = HTTPServer()
server.addHandler(MyHandler())
server.dispatch(HTTPRequest(...), args: "x") // returns false
server.dispatch(HTTPRequest(...), args: 5)   // returns false
server.dispatch(HTTPRequest(...), args: 10)  // returns true
```
