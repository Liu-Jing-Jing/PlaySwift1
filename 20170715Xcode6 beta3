- Array has been completely redesigned to have full value semantics to match the behavior of Dictionary and String. Now a let array is completely immutable, and a var array is completely mutable.
- Syntax “sugar” for Array and Dictionary has changed. Arrays are declared using [Int] as short hand for Array<Int>, instead of Int[]. Similarly, Dictionary uses [Key: Value] for Dictionary<Key, Value>.
- The half-open range operator has been changed from .. to ..< to make it more clear alongside the ... operator for closed ranges.
