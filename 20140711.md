Compatibility
One of the most common questions we heard at WWDC was, “What is the compatibility story for Swift?”. This seems like a great first topic.

## Swift开发的app兼容2013年发布的iOS 7和OS X 10.9系统
App Compatibility
Simply put, if you write a Swift app today and submit it to the App Store this Fall when iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite are released, you can trust that your app will work well into the future. 
In fact, you can target back to OS X Mavericks or iOS 7 with that same app. This is possible because Xcode embeds a small Swift runtime library within your app’s bundle. 
Because the library is embedded, your app uses a consistent version of Swift that runs on past, present, and future OS releases.
Binary Compatibility and Frameworks
While your app’s runtime compatibility is ensured, the Swift language itself will continue to evolve, and the binary interface will also change. To be safe, all components of your app should be built with the same version of Xcode and the Swift compiler to ensure that they work together.
This means that frameworks need to be managed carefully. For instance, if your project uses frameworks to share code with an embedded extension, you will want to build the frameworks, app, and extensions together. It would be dangerous to rely upon binary frameworks that use Swift — especially from third parties. As Swift changes, those frameworks will be incompatible with the rest of your app. When the binary interface stabilizes in a year or two, the Swift runtime will become part of the host OS and this limitation will no longer exist.
Source Compatibility
Swift is ready to use today, in brand new apps or alongside your proven Objective-C code. We have big plans for the Swift language, including improvements to syntax, and powerful new features. And as Swift evolves, we will provide tools in Xcode to help you migrate your source code forward.
We can’t wait to see what you build!

## Building assert() in Swift, Part 1: Lazy Evaluation 
- 文章的更新: This post has been updated to reflect a change in Xcode 6 beta 5 that 重命名 @auto_closure 变成 @autoclosure, and LogicValue 变成 BooleanType.

When designing Swift we made a key decision to do away with the C preprocessor, eliminating bugs and making code much easier to understand. This is a big win for developers, but it also means Swift needs to implement some old features in new ways. Most of these features are obvious (importing modules, conditional compilation), but perhaps the most interesting one is how Swift supports macros like assert().

When building for release in C, the assert() macro has no runtime performance impact because it doesn’t evaluate any arguments. One popular implementation in C looks like this:


```#ifdef NDEBUG
#define assert(e)  ((void)0)
#else
#define assert(e)  \
	((void) ((e) ? ((void)0) : __assert (#e, __FILE__, __LINE__)))
#define __assert(e, file, line) \
	((void)printf ("%s:%u: failed assertion `%s'\n", file, line, e), abort())
#endif
```

#Swift’s assert analog provides almost all of the functionality of C’s assert, without using the preprocessor, and in a much cleaner way. Let’s dive in and learn about some interesting features of Swift.

Lazy Evaluation of Arguments
When implementing assert() in Swift, the first challenge we encounter is that there is no obvious way for a function to accept an expression without evaluating it. For example, say we tried to use:

func assert(x : Bool) {
	#if !NDEBUG

		/*noop*/
	#endif
}
Even when assertions are disabled, the application would take the performance hit of evaluating the expression:

assert(someExpensiveComputation() != 42)
One way we could fix this is by changing the definition of assert to take a closure:

func assert(predicate : () -> Bool) {
	#if !NDEBUG
		if !predicate() {
			abort()
		}
	#endif
}
This evaluates the expression only when assertions are enabled, like we want, but it leaves us with an unfortunate calling syntax:

assert({ someExpensiveComputation() != 42 })
We can fix this by using the Swift @autoclosure attribute. The auto-closure attribute can be used on an argument to a function to indicate that an unadorned expression should be implicitly wrapped in a closure to the function. The example then looks like this:

func assert(predicate : @autoclosure () -> Bool) {
	#if !NDEBUG
		if !predicate() {
			abort()
		}
	#endif
}
This allows you to call it naturally, as in:

assert(someExpensiveComputation() != 42)
Auto-closures are a powerful feature because you can conditionally evaluate an expression, evaluate it many times, and use the bound expression in any way a closure can be used. Auto-closures are used in other places in Swift as well. For example, the implementation of short-circuiting logical operators looks like this:

func &&(lhs: BooleanType, rhs: @autoclosure () -> BooleanType) -> Bool {
	return lhs.boolValue ? rhs().boolValue : false
}
By taking the right side of the expression as an auto-closure, Swift provides proper lazy evaluation of that subexpression.

Auto-Closures
As with macros in C, auto-closures are a very powerful feature that must be used carefully because there is no indication on the caller side that argument evaluation is affected. Auto-closures are intentionally limited to only take an empty argument list, and you shouldn’t use them in cases that feel like control flow. Use them when they provide useful semantics that people would expect (perhaps for a “futures” API) but don’t use them just to optimize out the braces on closures.

This covers one special aspect of the implementation of assert in Swift, but there is more to come.


# Xcode6 beta4 release 20140721
# Access Control
In Xcode 6 beta 4, Swift adds support for access control. This gives you complete control over what part of the code is accessible within a single file, available across your project, or made public as API for anyone that imports your framework. The three access levels included in this release are:

private entities are available only from within the source file where they are defined.
internal entities are available to the entire module that includes the definition (e.g. an app or framework target).
public entities are intended for use as API, and can be accessed by any file that imports the module, e.g. as a framework used in several of your projects.
By default, all entities have internal access. This allows application developers to largely ignore access control, and most Swift code already written will continue to work without change. Your framework code does need to be updated to define public API, giving you total control of the exposed interface your framework provides.

The private access level is the most restrictive, and makes it easy to hide implementation details from other source files. By properly structuring your code, you can safely use features like extensions and top-level functions without exposing that code to the rest of your project.

Developers building frameworks to be used across their projects need to mark their API as public. While distribution and use of 3rd-party binary frameworks is not recommended (as mentioned in a previous blog post), Swift supports construction and distribution of frameworks in source form.

In addition to allowing access specification for an entire declaration, Swift allows the get of a property to be more accessible than its set. Here is an example class that is part of a framework:

public class ListItem {

	// Public properties.
	public var text: String
	public var isComplete: Bool

	// Readable throughout the module, but only writeable from within this file.
	private(set) var UUID: NSUUID

	public init(text: String, completed: Bool, UUID: NSUUID) {
		self.text = text
		self.isComplete = completed
		self.UUID = UUID
	}

	// Usable within the framework target, but not by other targets.
	func refreshIdentity() {
		self.UUID = NSUUID()
	}

	public override func isEqual(object: AnyObject?) -> Bool {
		if let item = object as? ListItem {
			return self.UUID == item.UUID
		}
		return false
	}
}
When mixing Objective-C and Swift, because the generated header for a framework is part of the framework’s public Objective-C interface, only declarations marked public appear in the generated header for a Swift framework. For applications, the generated header contains both public and internal declarations.

For more information, The Swift Programming Language and Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C books have been updated to cover access control. Read the complete Xcode 6 beta 4 release notes here.

# Interacting with C Pointers 7月23开始添加与C语言指针交互
Objective-C and C APIs often require the use of pointers. Data types in Swift are designed to feel natural when working with pointer-based Cocoa APIs, and Swift automatically handles several of the most common use cases for pointers as arguments. In this post we’ll look at how pointer parameters in C can be used with the variables, arrays, and strings in Swift.

Pointers as In/Out Parameters
C and Objective-C don’t support multiple return values, so Cocoa APIs frequently use pointers as a way of passing additional data in and out of functions. Swift allows pointer parameters to be treated like inout parameters, so you can pass a reference to a var as a pointer argument by using the same & syntax. For instance, UIColor’s getRed(_:green:blue:alpha:) method takes four CGFloat* pointers to receive the components of the color. We can use & to collect these components into local variables:

var r: CGFloat = 0, g: CGFloat = 0, b: CGFloat = 0, a: CGFloat = 0
color.getRed(&r, green: &g, blue: &b, alpha: &a)
Another common case is the Cocoa NSError idiom. Many methods take an NSError** parameter to save an error in case of failure. For instance, we can list the contents of a directory using NSFileManager’s contentsOfDirectoryAtPath(_:error:) method, saving the potential error directly to an NSError? variable:

var maybeError: NSError?
if let contents = NSFileManager.defaultManager()
	.contentsOfDirectoryAtPath("/usr/bin", error: &maybeError) {
	// Work with the directory contents
} else if let error = maybeError {
	// Handle the error
}
For safety, Swift requires the variables to be initialized before being passed with &. This is because it cannot know whether the method being called tries to read from a pointer before writing to it.

Pointers as Array Parameters
Pointers are deeply intertwined with arrays in C, and Swift facilitates working with array-based C APIs by allowing Array to be used as a pointer argument. An immutable array value can be passed directly as a const pointer, and a mutable array can be passed as a non-const pointer argument using the & operator, just like an inout parameter. For instance, we can add two arrays a and b using the vDSP_vadd function from the Accelerate framework, writing the result to a third result array:

import Accelerate

let a: [Float] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let b: [Float] = [0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625]
var result: [Float] = [0, 0, 0, 0]

vDSP_vadd(a, 1, b, 1, &result, 1, 4)

// result now contains [1.5, 2.25, 3.125, 4.0625]
Pointers as String Parameters
C uses const char* pointers as the primary way to pass around strings. A Swift String can be used as a const char* pointer, which will pass the function a pointer to a null-terminated, UTF-8-encoded representation of the string. For instance, we can pass strings directly to standard C and POSIX library functions:

puts("Hello from libc")
let fd = open("/tmp/scratch.txt", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT, 0o666)

if fd < 0 {
	perror("could not open /tmp/scratch.txt")
} else {
	let text = "Hello World"
	write(fd, text, strlen(text))
	close(fd)
}
Safety with Pointer Argument Conversions
Swift works hard to make interaction with C pointers convenient, because of their pervasiveness within Cocoa, while providing some level of safety. However, interaction with C pointers is inherently unsafe compared to your other Swift code, so care must be taken. In particular:

These conversions cannot safely be used if the callee saves the pointer value for use after it returns. The pointer that results from these conversions is only guaranteed to be valid for the duration of a call. Even if you pass the same variable, array, or string as multiple pointer arguments, you could receive a different pointer each time. An exception to this is global or static stored variables. You can safely use the address of a global variable as a persistent unique pointer value, e.g.: as a KVO context parameter.
Bounds checking is not enforced when a pointer to an Array or String is passed. A C-based API can’t grow the array or string, so you must ensure that the array or string is of the correct size before passing it over to the C-based API.
If you need to work with pointer-based APIs that don’t follow these guidelines, or you need to override Cocoa methods that accept pointer parameters, then you can work directly with raw memory in Swift using unsafe pointers. We’ll look at a more advanced case in a future post.


# 更新文件与初始 构造函数的语法
By now, most of you have written a small Swift app or experimented in the playground. You may even have experienced an error after you copied code from a playground into another file and wondered, “What is actually going on? What is the difference between a playground file, and other Swift source files?” This post will explain how Swift deals with the files in your project, and how global data is initialized.

Files in an App
A Swift app is composed of any number of files, each with the functions, classes, and other declarations that make up the app. Most Swift files in your app are order-independent, meaning you can use a type before it is defined, and can even import modules at the bottom of the file (although that is not recommended Swift style.)

However, top-level code is not allowed in most of your Swift source files. For clarity, any executable statement not written within a function body, within a class, or otherwise encapsulated is considered top-level. We have this rule because if top-level code were allowed in all your files, it would be hard to determine where to start the program.

Playgrounds, REPL, and Top-Level Code
You may be wondering why the code below works perfectly in a playground. This example isn’t encapsulated in anything, so it must be top-level code:

println("Hello world")
The above single-line program works — with no additional code at all — because playground files do support the execution of top-level code. Code within a playground file is order-dependent, run in top-down lexical order. For example, you can’t use a type before you define it. Of course, Swift playground files can also define functions, classes, and any other legal Swift code, but they don’t need to. This makes it easy to learn the Swift language or try a new API without writing a lot of code to get started.

In addition to playgrounds, top-level code can also be run in the REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) or when launching Swift files as scripts. To use Swift for scripting, you can use shebang-style launching by starting your Swift file with “#!/usr/bin/xcrun swift” or type “xcrun swift myFile.swift” within Terminal.

Application Entry Points and “main.swift”
You’ll notice that earlier we said top-level code isn’t allowed in most of your app’s source files. The exception is a special file named “main.swift”, which behaves much like a playground file, but is built with your app’s source code. The “main.swift” file can contain top-level code, and the order-dependent rules apply as well. In effect, the first line of code to run in “main.swift” is implicitly defined as the main entrypoint for the program. This allows the minimal Swift program to be a single line — as long as that line is in “main.swift”.

In Xcode, Mac templates default to including a “main.swift” file, but for iOS apps the default for new iOS project templates is to add @UIApplicationMain to a regular Swift file. This causes the compiler to synthesize a main entry point for your iOS app, and eliminates the need for a “main.swift” file.

Alternatively, you can link in an implementation of main written in Objective-C, common when incrementally migrating projects from Objective-C to Swift.

Global Variables
Given how Swift determines where to start executing an app, how should global variables work? In the following line of code, when should the initializer run?

var someGlobal = foo()
In a single-file program, code is executed top-down, similar to the behavior of variables within a function. Pretty simple. The answer for complex apps is less obvious, and we considered three different options:

Restrict initializers of global variables to be simple constant expressions, as C does.
Allow any initializer, run as a static constructor at app load time, as C++ does.
Initialize lazily, run the initializer for a global the first time it is referenced, similar to Java.
The first approach was ruled out because Swift doesn’t need constant expressions like C does. In Swift, constants are generally implemented as (inlined) function calls. And there are good reasons to use complex initializers, e.g. to set up singletons or allocate a dictionary.

The second approach was ruled out because it is bad for the performance of large systems, as all of the initializers in all the files must run before the application starts up. This is also unpredictable, as the order of initialization in different files is unspecified.

Swift uses the third approach, which is the best of all worlds: it allows custom initializers, startup time in Swift scales cleanly with no global initializers to slow it down, and the order of execution is completely predictable.

The lazy initializer for a global variable (also for static members of structs and enums) is run the first time that global is accessed, and is launched as dispatch_once to make sure that the initialization is atomic. This enables a cool way to use dispatch_once in your code: just declare a global variable with an initializer and mark it private.

Summary
Swift is designed to make it easy to experiment in a playground or to quickly build a script. A complete program can be a single line of code. Of course, Swift was also designed to scale to the most complex apps you can dream up. With “main.swift” you can take complete control over initialization or you can let @UIApplicationMain do the startup work for you on iOS.
