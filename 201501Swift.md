# Redefining Everything with the Swift REPL

Our first entry on the REPL covered just the basics, showing how to use the REPL to experiment with Swift as you learn the language. This post explores one way that the REPL bends normal coding rules to give you new powers when developing.

Redefining Identifiers
The Swift compiler automatically protects against a wide range of programming mistakes, including unintentional ambiguity arising from defining the same identifier twice:

```swift
swiftc -
var x = "The Answer"
var x = 42
^D
error: invalid redeclaration of 'x'
```

This makes sense when coding in a non-interactive editor, but in the REPL interactive environment itâ€™s useful to be able to easily make changes. The REPL was specifically designed with this kind of convenience in mind:
```swift
  1> var x = "The Answer"
x: String = "The Answer"
  2> var x = 42
x: Int = 42
  3> x + 10
$R0: Int = 52
```

The newer definition replaces the existing definition for all subsequent references. As illustrated above, even the type of the definition can be changed in the process. This allows a wide range of experiments through iterative refinement. For example, you can start out with a recursive implementation of a function:
```swift
 4> func fib(index: Int) -> Int {
  if index <= 1 
  {
 		return 1
  }

  return fib(index - 1) + fib(index - 2)
}
 
 fib(40)
 
 $R1: Int = 165580141
```
