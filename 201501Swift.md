# Redefining Everything with the Swift REPL

Our first entry on the REPL covered just the basics, showing how to use the REPL to experiment with Swift as you learn the language. This post explores one way that the REPL bends normal coding rules to give you new powers when developing.

Redefining Identifiers
The Swift compiler automatically protects against a wide range of programming mistakes, including unintentional ambiguity arising from defining the same identifier twice:

```swift
swiftc -
var x = "The Answer"
var x = 42
^D
error: invalid redeclaration of 'x'
```
