# Xcode Beta 5发布后开始 改进值类型与引用类型
Value and Reference Types
Types in Swift fall into one of two categories: first, “value types”, where each instance keeps a unique copy of its data, usually defined as a struct, enum, or tuple. The second, “reference types”, where instances share a single copy of the data, and the type is usually defined as a class. In this post we explore the merits of value and reference types, and how to choose between them.

What’s the Difference?
The most basic distinguishing feature of a value type is that copying — the effect of assignment, initialization, and argument passing — creates an independent instance with its own unique copy of its data:
```
// Value type example
struct S { var data: Int = -1 }
var a = S()
var b = a						// a is copied to b
a.data = 42						// Changes a, not b
println("\(a.data), \(b.data)")	// prints "42, -1"
```

Copying a reference, on the other hand, implicitly creates a shared instance. After a copy, two variables then refer to a single instance of the data, so modifying data in the second variable also affects the original, e.g.:

```
// Reference type example
class C { var data: Int = -1 }
var x = C()
var y = x						// x is copied to y
x.data = 42						// changes the instance referred to by x (and y)
println("\(x.data), \(y.data)")	// prints "42, 42"
```
The Role of Mutation in Safety
One of the primary reasons to choose value types over reference types is the ability to more easily reason about your code. If you always get a unique, copied instance, you can trust that no other part of your app is changing the data under the covers. This is especially helpful in multi-threaded environments where a different thread could alter your data out from under you. This can create nasty bugs that are extremely hard to debug.

Because the difference is defined in terms of what happens when you change data, there’s one case where value and reference types overlap: when instances have no writable data. In the absence of mutation, values and references act exactly the same way.

You may be thinking that it could be valuable, then, to have a case where a class is completely immutable. This would make it easier to use Cocoa NSObject objects, while maintaining the benefits of value semantics. Today, you can write an immutable class in Swift by using only immutable stored properties and avoiding exposing any APIs that can modify state. In fact, many common Cocoa classes, such as NSURL, are designed as immutable classes. However, Swift does not currently provide any language mechanism to enforce class immutability (e.g. on subclasses) the way it enforces immutability for struct and enum.

How to Choose?
So if you want to build a new type, how do you decide which kind to make? When you’re working with Cocoa, many APIs expect subclasses of NSObject, so you have to use a class. For the other cases, here are some guidelines:

Use a value type when:

Comparing instance data with == makes sense
You want copies to have independent state
The data will be used in code across multiple threads
Use a reference type (e.g. use a class) when:

Comparing instance identity with === makes sense
You want to create shared, mutable state
In Swift, Array, String, and Dictionary are all value types. They behave much like a simple int value in C, acting as a unique instance of that data. You don’t need to do anything special — such as making an explicit copy — to prevent other code from modifying that data behind your back. Importantly, you can safely pass copies of values across threads without synchronization. In the spirit of improving safety, this model will help you write more predictable code in Swift.


# Access Control and protected 访问控制和修饰符protected的完善
The response to support for access control in Swift has been extremely positive. However, some developers have been asking, “Why doesn’t Swift have something like protected?” Many other programming languages have an access control option that restricts certain methods from being accessed from anywhere except subclasses.

When designing access control levels in Swift, we considered two main use cases:

- keep private details of a class hidden from the rest of the app
- keep internal details of a framework hidden from the client app
These correspond to private and internal levels of access, respectively.

In contrast, protected conflates access with inheritance, adding an entirely new control axis to reason about. It doesn’t actually offer any real protection, since a subclass can always expose “protected” API through a new public method or property. It doesn’t offer additional optimization opportunities either, since new overrides can come from anywhere. And it’s unnecessarily restrictive — it allows subclasses, but not any of the subclass’s helpers, to access something.

As some developers have pointed out, Apple frameworks do occasionally separate parts of API intended for use by subclasses. Wouldn’t protected be helpful here? Upon inspection, these methods generally fall into one of two groups. First, methods that aren’t really useful outside the subclass, so protection isn’t critical (and recall the helper case above). Second, methods that are designed to be overridden but not called. An example is drawRect(_:), which is certainly used within the UIKit codebase but is not to be called outside UIKit.

It’s also not clear how protected should interact with extensions. Does an extension to a class have access to that class’s protected members? Does an extension to a subclass have access to the superclass’s protected members? Does it make a difference if the extension is declared in the same module as the class?

There was one other influence that led us to the current design: existing practices of Objective-C developers both inside and outside of Apple. Objective-C methods and properties are generally declared in a public header (.h) file, but can also be added in class extensions within the implementation (.m) file. When parts of a public class are intended for use elsewhere within the framework but not outside, developers create a second header file with the class’s “internal” bits. These three levels of access correspond to public, private, and internal in Swift.

Swift provides access control along a single, easy-to-understand axis, unrelated to inheritance. We believe this model is simpler, and provides access control the way it is most often needed: to isolate implementation details to within a class or within a framework. It may be different from what you’ve used before, but we encourage you to try it out.


# Optionals Case Study: valuesForKeys  KVC的学习
This post explores how optionals help preserve strong type safety within Swift. We’re going to create a Swift version of an Objective-C API. Swift doesn’t really need this API, but it makes for a fun example.

In Objective-C, NSDictionary has a method -objectsForKeys:notFoundMarker: that takes an NSArray of keys, and returns an NSArray of corresponding values. From the documentation: “the N-th object in the returned array corresponds to the N-th key in [the input parameter] keys.” What if the third key isn’t actually in the dictionary? That’s where the notFoundMarker parameter comes in. The third element in the array will be this marker object rather than a value from the dictionary. The Foundation framework even provides a class for this case if you don’t have another to use: NSNull.

In Swift, the Dictionary type doesn’t have an objectsForKeys equivalent. For this exercise, we’re going to add one — as valuesForKeys in keeping with the common use of ‘value’ in Swift — using an extension:

扩展Dictionary的方法
```
extension Dictionary {
	func valuesForKeys(keys: [K], notFoundMarker: V) -> [V] {
		// To be implemented
	}
}
```
This is where our new implementation in Swift will differ from Objective-C. In Swift, the stronger typing restricts the resulting array to contain only a single type of element — we can’t put NSNull in an array of strings. However, Swift gives an even better option: we can return an array of optionals. All our values get wrapped in optionals, and instead of NSNull, we just use nil.


```
extension Dictionary {
	func valuesForKeys(keys: [Key]) -> [Value?] {
		var result = [Value?]()
		result.reserveCapacity(keys.count)
		for key in keys {
			result.append(self[key])
		}
		return result
	}
}
```

NOTE: Some of you may have guessed why a Swift Dictionary doesn’t need this API, and already imagined something like this:
```
extension Dictionary {
	func valuesForKeys(keys: [Key]) -> [Value?] {
		return keys.map { self[$0] }
	}
}
```

This has the exact same effect as the imperative version above, but all of the boilerplate has been wrapped up in the call to map. This is great example why Swift types often have a small API surface area, because it’s so easy to just call map directly.

Now we can try out some examples:

```
let dict = ["A": "Amir", "B": "Bertha", "C": "Ching"]

dict.valuesForKeys(["A", "C"])
// [Optional("Amir"), Optional("Ching")]

dict.valuesForKeys(["B", "D"])
// [Optional("Bertha"), nil]

dict.valuesForKeys([])
// []
```

Nested Optionals
Now, what if we asked for the last element of each result?

dict.valuesForKeys(["A", "C"]).last
// Optional(Optional("Ching"))

dict.valuesForKeys(["B", "D"]).last
// Optional(nil)

dict.valuesForKeys([]).last
// nil
That’s strange — we have two levels of Optional in the first case, and Optional(nil) in the second case. What’s going on?

Remember the declaration of the last property:

var last: T? { get }
This says that the last property’s type is an Optional version of the array’s element type. In this case, the element type is also optional (String?). So we end up with String??, a doubly-nested optional type.

So what does Optional(nil) mean?

Recall that in Objective-C we were going to use NSNull as a placeholder. The Objective-C version of these three calls looks like this:

[dict valuesForKeys:@[@"A", @"C"] notFoundMarker:[NSNull null]].lastObject
// @"Ching"

[dict valuesForKeys:@[@"B", @"D"] notFoundMarker:[NSNull null]].lastObject
// NSNull

[dict valuesForKeys:@[] notFoundMarker:[NSNull null]].lastObject
// nil
In both the Swift and Objective-C cases, a return value of nil means “the array is empty, therefore there’s no last element.” The return value of Optional(nil) (or in Objective-C NSNull) means “the last element of this array exists, but it represents an absence.” Objective-C has to rely on a placeholder object to do this, but Swift can represent it in the type system.

Providing a Default
To wrap up, what if you did want to provide a default value for anything that wasn’t in the dictionary? Well, that’s easy enough.


```
extension Dictionary {
	func valuesForKeys(keys: [Key], notFoundMarker: Value) -> [Value] {
		return self.valuesForKeys(keys).map { $0 ?? notFoundMarker }
	}
}


dict.valuesForKeys(["B", "D"], notFoundMarker: "Anonymous")
// ["Bertha", "Anonymous"]
```
While Objective-C has to rely on a placeholder object to do this, Swift can represent it in the type system, and provides rich syntactic support for handling optional results.
